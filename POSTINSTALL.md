# Manual things to do after setup

Some manual work is still required 🤷‍♂️

## Install Setapp & Favorite Apps

For some software I use [Setapp](https://setapp.com/) (💳 PAID). This service gives you access to big list of paid application by using one subscription.

Some of the apps available in Setapp:

* [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/) - code snippets manager.
* [CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com/) - Screenshot and screen record tool.
* [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) - Allows you to hide items inside menu bar.
* [Folx](https://mac.eltima.com/download-manager.html) - Download manager
* [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/en/welcome.html) - Get rid of intrusive ads and online tracking

1. Install [Setapp](https://setapp.com/).
2. Open Preferences -> disabled "Enable Launcher in manu bar" -> disable "Open automatically after installation".
2. Install apps saved in "Favorites" list.
